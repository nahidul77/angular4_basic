@ node_modules (This is where we store all the third party library for the development, we are not going to deploy node_modules. part of this third party library we put in a bundle and deploy in a application)

@ Every application has at least one component and one module.

- src/assets (We will add static files to this folder such as image, text, icon)
- src/environments (configuaration settings for different Enviroment, so we have one file for production another for development)
- index.html (insert everything here dynamically)
- main.ts (starting point of our application, bootstraping the main module which is AppModule, so angular load this module and everything starts from here)
- polyfills.ts (fill the gap between the feature that js and angular needs also features supported by current browser)
- styles.css (Global css)
- editorconfig (make sure all the developer of the team use same config)
- karma.conf.js (test runner)
- package.json (every node project have this file, app name, version and dependencies, devdependencies library (angular/cli, karma) for development such as test runner which will not use in production)
